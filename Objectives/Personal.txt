Lovers
You and a character of the opposite sex must survive using the same method of survival (CSS pod, bunker, hibernation)
If you have activated your knowledge, you may complete this objective with a character of the same sex.


Afraid of the Dark
Call your mom (send the signal).
AND
You are not in darkness at the end of the game (carry a flashlight with uses remaining or hibernate in a section with power).


In the Name of Science
All intruder weaknesses must be discovered.
THEN
Send the signal.
BUT
You do not need to survive.
--- OR ---
You have a larva on your character board.
BUT
You do not need to survive the contamination check (you still have to survive the contingency check).


Clear the Evidence
Each revealed room with a computer must have a fire and/or malfunction marker.
OR
No character (other than you) sends the signal and the ship is destroyed.
OR
You are the only survivor.


Martyr
All other characters must survive.
AND
You must not survive.
